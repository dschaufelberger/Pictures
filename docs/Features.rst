Features
========

Some of the features that **Pictures** provides will be listed and described in
the following.

Folder View
-----------
**Pictures** will always work on your current selected folder, therefore it will
provide you with a list of (image) files that are present inside this folder.
You will be able to select different styles of representation for this list of
files, e.g. name only, details, thumbnails. Also ordering of the listed files can
be selected separately.
The folder you want to work on can be changed at any time.

*Note: The order of files displayed is probably different from the order the files are displayed in your file manager!*

Drag and Drop Files
-------------------

You can drag and drop files to copy them into the folder you're working on or you
may copy them to another external location outside of **Pictures**. Drag and drop
inside the Folder View is only possible in `custom order mode`_ and is used to move
the files inside the folder.


Ordering Files
--------------
.. _custom order mode:

Next to the common types of ordering the files (by name, by dates, by type, by size, etc.),
**Pictures** also provides a custom ordering. While in custom order mode you can
move the files freely inside the list.

    .. The latest type of order and the actual file ordering can and maybe should be
        remembered for user experience.
